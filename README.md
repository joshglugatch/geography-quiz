<br>
This webpage is a Geography Quiz! The quiz functions using JavaScript to generate questions, compare values for answers, and keep the quiz running. It begins with a start button that takes users to the first question and begins a timer. When answers are incorrect it subtracts time from the timer. If the timer reaches zero you fail the quiz, with a score of zero. However if you pass the quiz with time left, your score will be equal to the amount of time left. Once the quiz is finished the user will be brought to a page displaying their score along with a list of their previous high scores.

There are only five questions so I hope you get them right!

To check if the user clicked the correct answer, the correct answers array is compared to the value of the button that was chosen. Correct answers will prompt a green text that says "Correct" and incorrect answers will prompt a red text that says "Incorrect".
